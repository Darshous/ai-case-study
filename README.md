## Overview
As the newly appointed leader of our companies U.S. based AI integration team, I believe it is imperative for industry professionals to prioritize the enhancement of employee capabilities through AI, rather than solely focusing on the elimination of specific roles as a direct gain to the bottom line. While it is inevitable that AI will reshape job functions and daily tasks, it is crucial to recognize that human experience and a sense of fulfillment are essential components of meaningful work.

AI, by its very nature, lacks the intrinsic motivation to ensure task completion or to use saved time for personal enrichment. It remains indifferent to quarterly profits, milestone achievements, and the overall well-being of employees. The true value of AI-driven efficiency lies in its potential to empower us to enrich our lives, our families, and our communities.

## Company Information and Business Activities

For this case study, I have selected Fireflies.ai (Fireflies AI Corp.), a company dedicated to enhancing team experiences by automatically recording and transcribing meetings across various platforms. Fireflies.ai operates in the AI, meeting software, and productivity space, competing with industry giants such as Google and Microsoft, as well as smaller, more agile companies like Notiv and SummitSync.

Founded in July 2016 by Krish Ramineni and Sam Udotong and based in San Francisco, California, Fireflies.ai boasts over 16 million users and a monthly site visit growth rate of 7.46%.(Crunchbase) The company has secured $19 million in funding from inception to May 2021 across twelve investors, including two venture capital firms.

Fireflies.ai addresses the challenge of excessive meetings and limited time. Our increased reliance on online meetings to bring together cross-functional teams has created a difficult environment for maintaining attention to meeting agendas and staying engaged. It is all too easy to become distracted and potentially miss critical moments, such as time-sensitive tasks and key objective preparation.

In the post-COVID-19 era of online meeting spaces, keeping teams aligned and effectively communicating has never been more important. The software and tools provided by Fireflies.ai enable teams to stay present and focused, knowing that notes and background data are being collected for later review and analysis.

Fireflies.ai has also adopted a new technology utilizing natural language processing to analyze meeting participants' language, word choice, and mood. This is known as opinion mining or emotional AI (Fireflies Blog). This information can be invaluable when trying to understand the impact of certain actions on customers in pitch meetings or other introductions. Over time, strategies can be developed to help organizations maximize customer relationships.

For example, a company preparing several new product line ideas for a customer may find that, in a series of meetings leading up to the main proposal, the emotional AI program detects that the buyers are significantly more excited about two offerings. This information confirms the suspicions of the account manager. The presenting company reviews this with the marketing team and pivots the presentation to feature these two products. They are able to conduct a more in-depth analysis of the two driving products and identify significant advantages to the customer that can be further highlighted. Without this technology, a less directed approach might have been taken, and resources might have been spread too thin to identify the key points necessary to secure the account.

Over the last several years, we have observed a shift in the online meeting space. While this has been for the better in most cases, those who study changes in human-to-human interactions understand the need for new engagement tools.

Companies must evolve to offer more sophisticated ways to communicate, collaborate, and connect. Adopting a more dynamic, inclusive, and effective meeting style will be crucial. Meetings should not merely be seen as necessary evils but as genuinely productive and engaging experiences (i.e., Smart Systems). Whiteboards, live polls, and real-time feedback are just the beginning. A few industry players have started researching the impact of eye tracking, facial expression tracking, and other biometric data to understand meeting engagement (iMotions).

## Recommendations

In the highly competitive online meeting space, Fireflies.ai is well-regarded among its peers. Rated 5/5 stars by G2, Fireflies.ai outscores Google Cloud's Speech-to-Text software. Fathom, a strong competitor, ranks similarly to Fireflies.ai but with significantly more reviews. A free version of the software likely drives this additional adoption, suggesting that Fireflies.ai may want to consider other marketing strategies to bolster online engagement with non-enterprise customers.

Looking ahead, Fireflies.ai should continue to focus on building a more engaging environment for collaborative efforts. As the online meeting space continues to capture an increasing amount of time and energy from productive teams, ensuring that every minute of collaborative time is seen as highly valuable and enriching should be a top priority. Exploring solutions that captivate team members' attention and finding ways to quantify and qualify participation will position Fireflies.ai to lead the market in online collaborative enrichment tools.
